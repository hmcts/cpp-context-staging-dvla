/**
 * Picks which {@link AzureResourceResolver} applies, based on
 * {@link AzureEmulatorConfiguration#isLocalEmulatorEnabled()} — scoped to the notify-gateway
 * Service Bus client (DVLAFS-12); the blob file-store path is out of scope and keeps its own
 * separate, untouched credential-selection logic. The two implementations are plain
 * constructor-wired objects, not CDI beans in their own right — if they were, CDI would see three
 * unqualified {@link AzureResourceResolver} beans (the two implementations plus this producer's
 * own output) and fail injection with an ambiguous-resolution error.
